# sql-library-manager
 This project is a CRUD application to help a fictional local library manage its book collection. It's a dynamic website that utilizes a SQL database for data persistence, and incorporates JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

 The home page features a full listing of the library's book collection. Users can click on a title to view/read that book's record, and can also edit/update a book's record. The app's functionality also enables users to create new records, or delete existing records from the database.
